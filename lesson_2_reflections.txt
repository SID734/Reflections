What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Empty git repository is created with name '.git'. We need this to save the commits i.e. to save all committed versions of the project.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
Staging area stores changes made in working directory but are not committed yet. So if we undo the changes manually in working directory , it still posses the version of file with previous changes on temporary basis.
