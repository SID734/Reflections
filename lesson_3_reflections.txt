When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    When more people are working on a single project who are remotely located then this will be better to access the changes in repository from one place.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Pulling changes manually simply gives better control over git repository on local machine. Since if there are multiple persons then they can create a file on github for other's reference. So others may or may not download these.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    forks is used to make copy of someone's repository on Github only.
	clone is used to clone repository either from remote or local repository.
	branches are used to create separate version of project on which developer can work independently without affecting master branch and not showing its changes.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
